        <p> 
            Alex Foster is a professional, a father, a husband, and three time Lee Country Fair Blueberry Pie Eating Champion. He passes the weekdays in the payroll office at Liberty Mutual, but in the evenings and on the weekends he can be found winning board games, changing the occasional diaper, or watching the latest episode of Survivor (he's seen every season!). Alex is an average Patriots fan, he used to be an avid fan, but then he was let down in the 2007 season when the team went 18-1, losing in the Super Bowl.

            Alex hates small talk, but loves talking about travel.You should definitely ask him about the time he got detained by border patrol. He's been to too many countries to count, five out of seven continents, and has a special place in his heart for bonnie Scotland. After living there off and on for seven years, he moved back to the states to settle down and get married. But the travel hasn't stopped, and he love to hear about your adventures. He's particularly keen on learning about different cultures, so the more authentic the travel, the better.
